Hi. I'm Rick van Dam and this is my blog. I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Team Rockstars IT. My blog is mostly going to center around programming with maybe the occasional post about photography.

In my free time I am working on my smarthome, or I take my camera somewhere to take beautiful photo's. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/barsonax) .
