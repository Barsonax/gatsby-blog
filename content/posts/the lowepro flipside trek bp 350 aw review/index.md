## Intro
I needed a bigger more comfortable backpack than my [Lowepro Slingshot Edge 250 AW](https://amzn.to/3w08Ouw). After some research I came accross the [Lowepro Flipside Trek BP 350 AW](https://amzn.to/3GtRxic) backpack and decided to buy it as it strikes a nice balance between carrying camera gear and being able to carry some other stuff such as clothes. This is quite a useful feature when traveling with a single backpack. Having used the backpack during a trip to the Sahara in Morocco where I could only bring my backpack to the desert I can confirm this is a excellent backpack well worth the money.

## Overview
The Lowepro Flipside Trek comes in 3 different sizes which you can recognize by the number. The 250 is the smallest, 350 sits in the middle and the 450 is the biggest. In my case I went for the 350 as this was big enough for my mirrorless camera and lenses. I believe other than size the bags are pretty much similar in terms of features.

Speaking of features this backpack has quite alot:

- Camera section that can fit a camera with attached lens (a 70-200 should fit) and some additional lenses. In my case I could put my [Tamron 17-28 F2.8](https://amzn.to/3Cod1ui), [Tamron 28-75 F2.8](https://amzn.to/3vW4pZl) and my [Sony 85mm F1.8](https://amzn.to/3pGq9rb) in here with one of these attached to my camera. You can rearrange this section to your wishes as bag comes with plenty of Velcro sections.
- General purpose section.
- Tablet section, I don't have a tablet but I used this to store some extra clothing.
- Can comfortably carry a decently sized tripod (mine weights around 1.5kg)
- One of the few bags with 2 water bottle holders (these could also hold a small tripod or other stuff)
- Chest and hip support but also a vented back panel for extra comfort. You can carry this bag all day if you want.
- The bag is padded and quite sturdy to protect your gear but also your back.
- Flipside access allowing you to access your camera without setting down the bag on the ground.
