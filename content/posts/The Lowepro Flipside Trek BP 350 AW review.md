## Intro
I needed a bigger more comfortable backpack than my Lowepro Slingshot Edge 250 AW. After some research I came accross the Lowepro Flipside Trek BP 350 AW backpack and decided to buy it as it strikes a nice balance between carrying camera gear and being able to carry some other stuff such as clothes. This is quite a useful feature when traveling with a single backpack. Having used the backpack during a trip to the Sahara in Morocco where I could only bring my backpack to the desert I can confirm this is a excellent backpack well worth the money.

## Overview
The Lowepro Flipside Trek comes in 3 different sizes which you can recognize by the number. The 250 is the smallest, 350 sits in the middle and the 450 is the biggest. I believe other than size the bags are pretty much similar in terms of features.

Speaking of features this backpack has quite alot:
- Can comfortably carry a decently sized tripod (mine weights around 1.5kg)
- Has 2 water bottle holders (these could also hold a small tripod or other stuff)
- Chest and hip support for extra comfort
- The bag is padded and quite sturdy to protect your gear but also your back.
- Flipside access allowing you to access your camera without setting down the bag on the ground.
