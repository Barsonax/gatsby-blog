## Intro
I needed a bigger more comfortable backpack than my Lowepro Slingshot Edge 250 AW. After some research I came accross the Lowepro Flipside Trek BP 350 AW backpack and decided to buy it as it strikes a nice balance between carrying camera gear and being able to carry some other stuff such as clothes. This is quite a useful feature when traveling with a single backpack. Having used the backpack during a trip to the Sahara in Morocco where I could only bring my backpack to the desert I can confirm this is a excellent backpack well worth the money.
