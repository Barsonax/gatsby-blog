Some time ago I decided to switch from Jekyll to another static site generator. My main reason was that is was more work than I would like to setup a development environment for Jekyll on windows as it involved getting a working ruby environment.

## Hugo

As I wanted a easy to setup development environment [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) seemed like logical choice and it was. Hugo is just a binary file and they even provide a [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package:

```posh
choco install hugo -confirm
```

Hugo delivers on the build performance they promise as well. Generating your site is almost instant and probably faster than any other static site generator. 

You can make a site from scratch with Hugo but its much easier to just choose a [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/). However when it comes to customizing your site it can be a bit harder. There less options here but you can do quite a bit if you learn how Hugo templates work. All things considered I was still quite happy with Hugo but in the end I did want to more easily customize my site.

## Gatsby

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Graphql](https://graphql.org/) to build your site. As such its quite easy to customize your site or even build it from scratch. There is also a huge amount of plugins which can do all kind of useful things such as SEO, image processing, PWA, code highlighting etc. Compared to Jekyll and Hugo I believe that Gatsby is the easiest to customize and brings in the most functionality. Everything is on npm so installing is not hard either but Gatsby also requires [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Did I already mention the performance of gatsby? No no not the build performance as that falls a bit between Jekyll and Hugo iam talking about the performance of the generated site. Maybe you already noticed that my blog loads almost instantly and this is among other things is thanks to Gatsby.

Working with gatsby does mean you have to learn React and Grahpql but I don't necessarily view this as a bad thing as these technologies are quite popular and thus worth it to learn.

If you want to get a gatsby site up and running fast you can pick one of the [starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2) which you can deploy to [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) easily by clicking on Netlify (next to Try this starter).

And now I'am done with migrating my blog to yet another generator :).
